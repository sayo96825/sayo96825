                         <p>
                               I have developed highly complicated laboratory infomation management system for an acutal client who was completely new to software development
                               from ground up with my wonderful teamates who were coming back from co-op program with actual industry experience. <br>
                               This gave me excellent hand on experince on groudn up software development and undestand why so many projects fail. <br>
                               Combining the experiece from using restraurant management system and knowing the user side of view and need, 
                               this was excellent oppotunity to develope user friendly system and the flow of the highly complecated and large scaled software system.

                                Was Covid boomer remover? According to my social media analysis of negativity toward boomer, 
                                the generational devide preexisted prior to Covid. However it brought attention of the generational divide into the surface.<br>
                                Once of the obstacle between the generation is the digizal divide especially among the older generation. <br>
                                With numeral years of customer service, POS and Human Computuer interaction knowlege combined, 
                                it is extremy difficult to develop a system that most older people feel comforatble. <br>
                                This was my attempt to creat a social media site for older deneration to promote the integration.
                                However approaching the older generation is harder than you think. 
                                With security concern, it comfortability level and , it is most

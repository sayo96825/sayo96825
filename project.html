                         <p>
                               I have developed highly complicated laboratory information management system for an actual client who was completely new to software development
                               from ground up with my wonderful teammates who were coming back from co-op program with industry experience. <br>
                               This gave me excellent hands on experience on software development and understand why so many projects fail. <br>
                               Combining the experience from using restaurant management system and knowing the user side of view and needs, 
                               this was excellent opportunity to develop user friendly system and the flow of the highly compliecated and large scaled software development.

                            &emsp;Why did the phrase like "boomer remover" and "Ok, boomer..." became viral on social media during covid?

                                According to my social media analysis of negativity toward boomer genearation, 
                                the generational devide pre-existed prior to Covid pandemic. However it brought more attention of the generational divide into the surface.<br>
                                One of the obstacle between the generation is the digital divide especially among the older generation.

                               &emsp; This was my attempt to creat a social media site for older generation to promote the integration.<br>
                               &emsp; The idea was that there are many people of older generation who has a lot of time. <br>  &emsp; So develop the platform that they can contribute their time and skill. <br>
                              &emsp; For example if you are ESL (English as Second Lanaguage) student, you can connect with English speaking people who has time to talk to you. 
                            <br>

                            <p> With numeral years of customer service, POS and Human Computuer interaction knowlege combined, 
                                it came to realization that it is extremy difficult to develop a system that most older people feel comforatble. <br>
                                It comes down to balance between security and accessibility. As you make system more accessible by giving easy access, it put security at risk. Security is high on older generations interest.
                                It was Canadian covid vaccine passport system of scanning QR code for the proof of vaccine to entire certain place that promoted some many people to get more familiar with technology. 
                                However the generetional conflict and devide will continue to grow, as economy starts to go into recession.

                            <h4>üî∑ Social Media Data Analysis Research on Autism Spectrum Disorder  &emsp;&emsp;<a href="https://github.com/sayo96825/UBC-Social-Media-Analysis-ASD.git">Link to github repo</a></h4>
                            &emsp; I wanted to study how people with ASD(autism spectrum disorder) use social media. However it is impossible to identify social media user who actually has ASD. Many people with autiam also does not seek diagnosys neither. 
                            In this research it is analysis of sicial media site, Reddit group with keyword related to ASD or Asperger. 
                            Is there anything particular about the people who choose to join the ASD related social media group.

                            <br>
                            <p> One of the most interesting finding from this research is that there might be certain patterns of reaction for "buzz".
                            When your post get lots of reaction, that encourage some people to post more and it can also deter some user initially.
                            On the other hand, some user does not change their behaibior regardress of positive or negative reaction from others. 
                            It wil be great to see how people of ASD reacts when their post buzz and how their behaviour change according to it.

                        <h1> Welcome to my webpage!</h1>   
                        <br>
                        <p> I am Sayo Everden. My backgournd is in psychology and I went back to school to persue my passion in data analysis.
                            I have recently graduated from the UBC with Bachelors in Computer Science, completed data science certifictes from UBC and Google and seeking opportunity in data science.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            I am originally from Osaka, Japan. 
                            I have been to Australia, US, and then to Canada. 
                            I was a star student in high school and I was awarded a scholarship to study in the Geelong Grammer school in Australia where King Charls has attended.
                            This oppotunity led me to aquire AA degree in the Hawaii, US. 
                            I was also a star student in the college that I was awarded the American Presidencial Award and the schalrship to UBC Vancouver.
                            I also had my daughter during this time and finished my pyshoclogy degree as a student mother.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Bakcgournd in Psychology has been a great foundation for raising my family, running family owned funeral home and managing resaurants. 
                            However it was frustrated to be surrounded by data everwhere without means to scientifilly analyze them.  
                            Now with my newly aquiquired programming and data analytics skill combined with my pschologogy background and manement experience, my interest is in data visualization, data ethics and accesibility.
